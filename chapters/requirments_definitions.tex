\chapter{Requirement definitions}

Introduction

After imbibing the general context of the project, we are going to focus in
the is chapter on providing a full description of out project, that we will be
calling Benchmarks Dashboard. To do so, we will start by analyzing the
requirements and extracting the  functional and non-functional specifications.
Then we will define the Product backlog of the project to achieve. Finally we
will present the general use cases of the project.

\section{Requirements analysis}

\subsection{Design session}
After  the beginning of the internship, we had a on-month training where we were
trained about the different technologies that Predictix is using, such as
LogiQL, Nix and LB. Also, as interns, we had the opportunity, first, to get
familiar with the company's working environment, second, understand better the
project's goal and its added value to its users, and third, were able to collect
the functional and non functional requirements of the project.


\subsection{Functional requirements}
Benchmarks Dashboard that we are expected to develop has to main
functionalities . 

\subsubsection{Start new benchmark}
BD should give the ability to start a new benchmark 

\subsubsection{Visualize the previous benchmarks}
BD should give the ability to the user to view previous benchmarks result.
